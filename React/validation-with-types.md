# Validating with PropType

## Define PropTypes for Components
In your TypeScript React components, you can define PropTypes using the PropTypes object provided by the prop-types library:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ title, description }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  description: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default MyComponent;
```
This defines a MyComponentProps interface to specify the expected props for MyComponent. Then it uses PropTypes to define the PropTypes for each prop.

## PropType Features:

### Runtime Validation: 
PropTypes provides runtime validation of props. It checks the types of props during runtime and issues warnings in development if the props don't match the specified types. This helps catch errors early during development.

### Documentation: 
PropTypes serve as a form of documentation for components. By specifying PropTypes, developers can understand what props are expected by a component and their types.

### Optional: 
PropTypes are optional. You can choose to use them or not, depending on your preference or project requirements. PropTypes are actually removed during the compling to make it more performant.

## TypeScript Types:

### Compile-time Type Checking:
TypeScript types provide static type-checking at compile time. This means that type errors are caught during development before the code is executed. This can lead to more robust code and fewer runtime errors.

### Strict Typing: 
TypeScript offers strict typing, which means that types are enforced more rigorously compared to PropTypes. TypeScript can infer types from the code or explicitly define types using annotations.

### Tooling Support: 
TypeScript provides better tooling support, such as code completion, refactoring, and type inference in modern code editors. This can improve developer productivity and reduce errors.

### Interfaces and Unions: 
TypeScript allows defining interfaces, types, and unions of types, providing more expressive and precise type definitions. This can lead to more maintainable and understandable code.

### Native Support: 
TypeScript is natively supported by the language, while PropTypes is a separate library that needs to be installed and imported into the project.
