# Coding for Screenreaders

1. Screen Reader Announcements
Ensure that changes in the state of UI components (like opening or closing of submenus) are announced properly:

Use aria-live Regions: Introduce sections of the page that are marked with aria-live="polite" or aria-live="assertive" for dynamic content changes, so that screen readers can announce these changes when they occur without disrupting the user's current activity.
2. Labeling and Instructions
Provide adequate labels and instructions which can be read by screen readers:

Descriptive Labels: Make sure all elements, especially interactive ones like buttons, have clear and descriptive labels using aria-label if the text content is not descriptive enough.
Instructions for Navigation: Provide instructions at the beginning of the navigation section on how to interact with the menu, especially for complex interfaces.
3. Text Alternatives for Visual Information
Offer text alternatives for any information conveyed through visual cues:

Visual Cues as Text: If visual cues like colors or styles are used to indicate active or disabled states, ensure these are also conveyed through text or screen reader-specific hints.
4. Logical Tab Order
Ensure the tab order is logical and follows the visual and functional flow of the application:

Consistent Navigation: Users should be able to navigate through items in a predictable and consistent order, matching the visual structure of the component.
5. Skip Navigation Link
Include skip navigation links at the beginning of the page to allow users to quickly navigate to main content or major sections:

Skip to Main Content: Provide a "Skip to main content" link at the top of the page, which becomes visible when focused (typically done via keyboard navigation).
6. Testing with Screen Readers
Regularly test your application with different screen readers and configurations:

Use Popular Screen Readers: Test with screen readers like JAWS, NVDA for Windows, VoiceOver for macOS and iOS, and TalkBack for Android to ensure compatibility and usability.
User Testing: If possible, involve real users who rely on these technologies to provide feedback on the usability of your application.
7. Accessibility Statement and Feedback
Provide an accessibility statement and a method for users to provide feedback on accessibility issues:

Accessibility Statement: This should outline your commitment to accessibility, the accessibility features provided, and how users can report issues or get help.
Feedback Mechanism: Offer a clear and simple way for users to provide feedback specifically about accessibility issues.
