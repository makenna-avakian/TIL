# Event Bus Pattern in Microservice Architecture 

## What is the Event Bus Pattern?

The event bus pattern is a design pattern where a software component (the event bus) acts as an intermediary channel that handles events between different microservices. Since in a microservice architectures, each microservice operates independently, and the event bus helps these services communicate by transmitting events that they can subscribe to or publish.

### Key Components
**Event Producers**: Microservices that generate events.
**Event Bus**: The central system that routes events from producers to consumers.
**Event Consumers**: Microservices that listen for and react to events.

## Components
**1. Decoupling**: Microservices don't see the details of other services, which encances maintainability and scalability.
**2. Asynchronous Communication**: This is by nautre an asyncronous operation, which has the benefit of non-blocking operations and increased performance.
**3. Fault Tolerance**: The event bus can buffer events during high load or failures, providing a level of resilience.

## Implementation of the Event Bus Pattern
### 1. Event Definition and Management
Define events that are published to the even bus. Every even should have a defined schema to prevent conflicts.

### 2. Service Integration
Integrate microservices with the event bus by implementing event producers and consumers. 

**Event Producers**
Event producers are services that publish events to the event bus. These events represent changes in state or data. Publishers do not care who is consuming their events.

**Event Consumers**
Event consumers are services that subscribe to events of interest on the event bus. Consumers have to susbscribe to events in order to process them.

### 3. Monitoring and Management
Have monitoring to track the performance of the event bus and the services interacting with it.
