# Accessibility

Accessible front-end design refers to the practice of creating web interfaces that can be easily navigated and used by people of all abilities, including those with disabilities. This involves ensuring that web applications support assistive technologies such as screen readers, adhere to consistent navigation patterns, offer keyboard navigability, and meet established accessibility standards like the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). This approach not only improves usability for all users but also ensures compliance with legal requirements.
