# Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, managing changes from various sources effectively. Git is essential for tracking revisions in software development, enabling developers to revert to previous states and collaborate on code without conflict.
