# Tailwind

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a vast array of predefined classes that can be used to build custom designs directly in your HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that offer predefined components, Tailwind enables developers to rapidly style their applications without leaving the HTML, promoting higher customizability and productivity through its design-first approach.
