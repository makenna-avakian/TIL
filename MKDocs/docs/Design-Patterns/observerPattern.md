# Observer Pattern in Monolithic Architecture 

## What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer pattern is a design pattern in monolithic architectures where a subject maintains a list of observers which get notified of any subject state changes, usually by calling a method. 

### Components of the Observer Pattern
**Subject**: Maintains a list of observers, facilitates adding or removing observers, and notifies them of events.
**Observers**: Objects that wish to receive updates from the subject.

## What the Observer Pattern does for Monolithic Architecture
Since in a monolithic architecture each component of the program is interconnected, the observer pattern does a few things for it.

**Decoupling of Components**: The Observer pattern helps in reducing dependencies amongst components. Components can remain independent of each other, while still being able to communicate through the defined events.

**Ease of Maintenance**: Changes in the state of one component can be communicated to other dependent components without hard-wiring the components together, making the system easier to maintain.

**Scalability Within the Monolith**: The oberver pattern allows for scalability in specific areas of the application. Although the application is a single codebase, internally it can scale parts that are under heavier loads by simply adding more observers to the crucial subjects.
