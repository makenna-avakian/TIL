# preventDefault()

preventDefault() is React's way of providing a way to prevent the behavior of certain events, such as form submissions or link clicks.

`preventDefault()` is a method available on event objects in JavaScript. It is used to stop the default action of an event from occurring. For example, when a form is submitted, the browser typically reloads the page. By calling `preventDefault()` on the submit event, you can prevent this default behavior.

## Places to use preventDefault():

### Form Submissions: 
When handling form submissions in React, you can prevent the default form submission behavior to perform custom validation or asynchronous operations, or prevent a page from rerendering.

### Link Clicks:
When handling clicks on anchor elements, you can to prevent the default navigation behavior to implement client-side routing.

### Keyboard Events: 
In certain cases, you cano prevent default keyboard shortcuts or actions from occurring when handling keyboard events.

## preventDefault() Example

Preventing a form submission:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MyForm extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the default form submission behavior
    // Perform custom form handling logic here
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

```
