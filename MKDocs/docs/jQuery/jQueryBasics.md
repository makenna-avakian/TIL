# What is jQuery

jQuery is a Javascript library which makes things like event handling, animation, and ajax much simpler by implementing an API that works across many browsers.

Essentially, you select an HTML element, then perform an action on that element.
 
## jQuery Syntax

Basic syntax is: 

```javascript
$(selector).action()
```
- A $ sign to define/access jQuery
- A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
- A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
