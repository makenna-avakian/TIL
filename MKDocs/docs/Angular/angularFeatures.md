# Introduction to Angular

Angular, like React, is a front-end web development framework which is widely used for building single page applications.

## Features

**Two-Way Data Binding**: Angular's two-way data binding automatically synchronizes the data between the model and view components. This feature simplifies the programming model and reduces the need for explicit DOM manipulation.

**TypeScript-based**: Angular applications are built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that includes type declarations. This allows for more maintainable code, advanced refactoring, and autocompletion tools, enhancing the development process.

**Component-based Architecture**: Angular introduces a component-based architecture that ensures applications are modular. This makes them easier to develop, test, maintain, and scale.

**Directives**: Angular provides powerful directives (custom HTML tags) that extend the functionality of HTML and allow you to create reusable components.

**Dependency Injection**: The framework has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps in developing and testing applications more efficiently.

**RxJS**: Angular extensively uses RxJS, a library for reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

**Angular CLI**: Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) tools automate tasks, making it easier to start, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.
