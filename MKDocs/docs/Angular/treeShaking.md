# Tree Shaking in Angular

Tree shaking is an optimization technique where unused Typescript code is eliminated from the final application bundle to keep the application as lightweight as possible.

## How it works
Tree shaking analyzes the import and export statements in your JavaScript and TypeScript files. A modern build tool, like Webpack used by Angular CLI, determines if a piece of code is being used anywhere in your application. If a function, class, or variable is not used, it is excluded from the final bundle.

## Benefits of Tree Shaking
**Reduced Bundle Size**: By removing unused code, the overall size of the application is reduced, leading to faster download and startup times.
**Improved Performance**: Less JavaScript to parse and execute can significantly enhance the performance, especially on mobile devices with slower processors.
**Enhanced Maintainability**: Less code means less complexity, making your application easier to maintain and debug.
