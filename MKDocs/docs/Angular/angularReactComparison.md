# Comparison with React

## Architecture:
**Angular**: It is a Model-View-Controller framework that provides a strong opinionated structure for your applications. Angular includes a wide array of features such as form validation, routing, state management, and HTTP client libraries.
**React**: React is not a full framework, it is more of a library focused only on building user interfaces, particularly through the view layer. It is less opinionated, giving developers the freedom to choose the additional libraries they need for routing, state management, etc. We use react to build micro-front ends with multi page applications.

## Development Language:
**Angular**: Angular applications are built using TypeScript.
**React**: React can be used with JavaScript or TypeScript. Using TypeScript with React has become more common, but it is not required from the start.

## Data Binding:
**Angular**: Angular uses two-way binding, which means that the Model and the View are linked so that changes in the Model automatically reflect in the View and vice versa, thus making it better for SPAs.
**React**: React uses one-way data binding, where the flow of data is directed only from the Model to the View. It uses a unidirectional data flow which makes it easier to track changes over time, thus making it better for MPAs.

## Component Management:
**Angular**: Angular has a more rigid, complex structure for component management with its dependency injection framework.
**React**: Reactâ€™s components are generally simpler and more lightweight. It promotes the use of functional components and hooks, which allow for reusing stateful logic between components without changing the component hierarchy.

## Performance:
**Angular**: Angular's performance is generally good for most applications, but the framework size can be larger due to its comprehensive feature set. Multiple techniques like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, lazy loading, and tree shaking can be used to improve performance.
**React**: React is known for its high performance, mainly due to the virtual DOM system that optimizes the re-rendering process. React can be more efficient in handling frequent UI updates.
