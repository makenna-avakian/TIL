# Lazy Loading in Angular

Lazy Loading in an optimization technique in Angular which speeds up the inital startup time by splitting the app into several bundles and loading them on demand.

## How it Works
Lazy loading is implemented by configuring the `RouterModule` to asynchronously load feature modules when they are required, rather than loading everything upfront. This is done by using the `loadChildren` method in the route configuration.

## Example
```typescript
Copy code
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'feature',
    loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule)
  }
];
```
In this configuration, FeatureModule is not loaded until the user navigates to the 'feature' path.

## Benefits of Lazy Loading
**Faster Initial Load**: By only loading the core app bundle initially, the time to interactive decreases, which is crucial for user retention.
**Bandwidth Conservation**: Lazy loading ensures that users only download the parts of the application they use, saving bandwidth and potentially reducing costs on mobile networks.
**Improved User Experience**: Users can interact with the initial content of the application faster, while other parts are loaded on demand, leading to a smoother experience.
